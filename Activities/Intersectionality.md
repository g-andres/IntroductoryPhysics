Inspired, of course, by [Chanda Prescod-Weinstein](...): "<great tweet on weak gravitational lensing as an analogy for racism, but the tweet seems to have been deleted>"

Some rough thoughts:

* people get simulations (or some other opaque source of information) to try to figure out "how the world works" or to deduce force laws or whatever.
* some people are given particles that interact one type of force, some with another.
    * I'm considering gravity and electromagnetic. I'd rather two that were completely distinct, but maybe this makes the point. Especially since EM will turn out to be so dominant.
* Then some sort of sharing
   * E.g. maybe you have to give directions to the other group?
   * Maybe you write a test for them to pass, or a problem for them to do?
* Analogies about "I don't see color"
* Punchline about how, if you're not a charged particle, you're wrong about how the world works.
* Intersectionality: listen to black women is like listen to the charged, massive particles.
* Whole bunch of stuff about being confidently wrong.
* Analogy about how straightforward it seems if you're seeing fewer of the basis vectors. E.g. if one group has $F_G >> F_{EM}$  and one has $F_{EM} >> F_G$ it seems straightforward to them. But if we give a different group $F_G \approx $F_{EM}$ I bet we get a situation where that group gets so confused that, in the same amount of time, they can't figure out how to get where they want to go!
